# Decoding Democracy Workshop

This project is from a workshop I attended on analyzing St Louis electoral data and visualizing patterns from the data using Tableau. The initial part of the workshop focused on mining usable data from the government electoral records (PDFs) by building Python functions that effectively extracted useful information. The code in this repository mainly focuses on this first part of the workshop.
